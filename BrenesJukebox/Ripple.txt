(Verse)
[PRESENT]
Every day I wake up with a single dream
Runnin' through my head
To throw a little stone into a mighty stream
And watch the ripples as they spread

Well, we fall in line, follow every rule
But is that something we should really take pride in?
’Cause we're treading water in the kiddie pool
When there are oceans we could turn the tide in

(Chorus)
If you wanna make a ripple
If you wanna makе a wave
Playing safe and thinking small
Doesn't movе the ball at all
There’s humanity to save

Can we really make a ripple
With our feet up while we float
Too afraid to rock the boat
If we never test the waters we'll never know
Just how far the ripples go

(Bridge)
Do you wanna make a ripple, ripple, ripple?
I think you wanna make a ripple, ripple, ripple

Consider the consequences!

[PRESENT]
Consider the possibilities!

Now if we choose this dude, one goes to two and four
And jumps from four to eight
(Ripple, ripple, ripple)
Yes, soon you guys, it multiplies to thousands more
Can you hear it reverberate?
(Ripple, ripple, ripple)
Then to millions and to billions and it never ends
All across the world the change is gaining some traction

[PAST]
Reaching other planets

[YET TO COME]
Maybe aliens

[PRESENT]
From one man we began a chain reaction
(If you wanna make a ripple
If you wanna make a ripple)
(Chorus)
[ALL]
If you wanna make a ripple
That can turn into a wave

[PRESENT]
Time to mean what we're about
Gotta turn this mother out
Friends, it's just called bein' brave

Maybe more than just a ripple
Make the choice to take a chance
Let's put on our big-boy pants
If we only skip the surface we'll never know
Just how far the ripples go

Do you wanna make a ripple, ripple, ripple?
I think you wanna make a ripple, ripple, ripple

Can we redeem the unredeemable?
Can we just risk it all and find a way?
Can we accomplish the impossible?
Well, it's impossible to say

But I have to believe inside the worst of us
There is some decency there
I know that we can achieve something miraculous
If we only dare
Damn right, I dare
If we wanna make a ripple
If we wanna make a wave
Let’s just fry some bigger fish
Ask forgiveness, not permish
There’s humanity to save

Make designs to make a ripple
'Cause you’ll barely make a dent
Giving ninety-nine percent
Go for broke 'cause it's finally time to know
Just how far the ripples go
Just how far the ripples go
Just how far the ripples
Just how far the ripples go
